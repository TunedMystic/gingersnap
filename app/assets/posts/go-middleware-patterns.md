## Getting started

Gingersnap is a static site generator built in Go. It converts markdown files into a fully functional website.

With a single command, users can setup an entire project, allowing them to jump straight into editing and content creation.

Projects have a limited set of features and configuration. This helps keep the blogging workflow streamlined and ensures a more straightforward experience for users.
