Hello! I'm Sandeep Jadoonanan, a software engineer with a passion for building. My journey began in college, where I was first to the world of code. Since then, I found myself spending every free moment buried in side projects, always eager to hone my skills further.

Over the years, I've been fortunate to be a part of several amazing tech companies. I've had the privilege of leading their teams and shaping their products. Despite these experiences, my heart always drifted back to the basics â€“ **Simple code, easy to read and easy to maintain**.

That's why I started Gingersnap. It's my way to share the knowledge and experience I've gained over the years. Here, you'll find programming tutorials and guides for various languages like [Python](/category/python/) and [Go](/category/go/).

My aim is to make programming accessible and understandable for all. My hope is for Gingersnap to be a valuable resource to support your programming journey. Thank you for being a part of this adventure. Here's to the exciting road ahead!
